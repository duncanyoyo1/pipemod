# pipemod
A 3D Printed Pipe Mod for the DNA60 chipset from Evolv

This repository will contain the OpenSCAD files as well as STL/AMF exports of the parts needed to actually print the mod yourself.

My focus was on keeping the number of parts down.

Currently you only need to print 5 files.

The main body, the fire, up and down buttons, the cap, and the battery sled.

You will find these files in the [Completed Files](pipemod/tree/main/Completed\ Files) directory.
